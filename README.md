# DinoGame
🦖 Google Dino game in Assembly Language

Authors: Haroon Ali, Shahab Bangash, Saad Bazaz

### How to run
Simply open DOSBOX or a similar ASM terminal and compile DinoGame.asm, and run.

### Note
Best gameplay is by increasing the CPU cycles to a million or so. Bugs here and there.
Improvements are welcome, don't hesitate to send a pull request.

### Credits
1. Haroon for writing the huge, magnificent core of the game. He's got quick hands
2. Shahab for score tracking and sound/music
3. Saad for doing nothing except [writing C++](https://github.com/SaadBazaz/antiPixel) and game art
